            Press Information Bureau is the nodal agency of the Government of
            India to disseminate information to the print and electronic media
            on government policies, programmes, initiatives and achievements. It
            functions as an interface between the government and media & also
            serves to provide feedback to the government on people reaction as
            reflected in the media.

          History of PIB
        </h1>
        <p>
          The history of Press Information Bureau can be traced back to the
          first World War Years, when a Central Publicity Board came into
          existence under the Home Member of the colonial Government. Later, a
          Cell was set up in the Home Department in June 1919 under Dr. L.F.
          Rushbrook Williams, to prepare a yearly report on India, for
          presentation to the British Parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the following year, the functions of the Cell were amplified to
          provide and supervise â€œthe distribution of correct information on all
          India questions and to inform Departments of Government of particular
          questions on which public opinion is exercised and on which further
          information is needed
        </p>
        <p>
          Towards the end of 1920, the Cell was rechristened as Central Bureau
          of Information & Dr. L.F. Rushbrook Williams became its Director. The
          designation of the Head of the Bureau was changed from Director to
          Principal Information Officer in 1938.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sh. J. Natarajan became the first Indian in 1941 to be appointed as
          Principal Information Officer and the Organizations name was changed
          to Press Information Bureau in 1946
        </p>
        <p>
          The bureaus functions, as visualized by Dr. Rushbrook Williams, were
          as follows:
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
          1. Present material in the form required by the Press, i.e., news
          stories.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
          2. Provide an agency news service, reporting facts without comment.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
          3. Exclude any material of a communal nature.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
          4. Rigorously exclude material of a political or controversial nature,
          except when attributable to a definite source.
        </h2>
